# Arduino-Line-Follower
A Program designed for a LineFollowerRobot

I believe a friend has the other part since I created the program in his computer, i will ask for it, for now the program has
the functions defined, the robot was created with 2 analog sensors connected to the A2 & A3 ports as well with 2 DC Motors connected
in the 6-7 and 10-11 pins, I will also search the SolidWorks Doc we used to cut the Robot in a Laser Cutter

Any Doubt you can contact me, i was responsable of the whole program, my team was in charge of the electrical connections
